# Implementation Plan & Roadmap (Final)

## Core Philosophy
- **Component-by-component development** following logical dependency order
- **Backend-first approach** - establish data and ML foundation before frontend
- **Incremental validation** - test each component thoroughly before proceeding
- **Platform integration** - validate multi-platform deployment at each stage

---

## Implementation Sequence & Rationale

### **Development Order Logic**
1. **Data Collection** → Foundation for everything else
2. **Data Engineering** → Process and validate collected data  
3. **Data Science** → Develop and validate ML models
4. **AI/ML Engineering** → Productionize models and create serving infrastructure
5. **MLOps** → Add monitoring, automation, and reliability
6. **Frontend** → Create user interface connecting to completed backend

### **Why This Order Works**
- **Dependencies flow naturally** - each component builds on previous
- **Early validation** - can test data quality and model performance early  
- **Risk mitigation** - most complex/risky components (ML) built first
- **Integration points clear** - backend API complete before frontend development
- **Platform deployment** - can deploy and test backend services before frontend
