# Phase 1: Data Collection - Implementation Log
```poetry env use python```


## Day 1: Environment Setup  ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks
* **09/06/25 - 18:31:00**  
✅ Project structure created (folder: Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis)  
✅ Poetry dependencies installed  
✅ Environment variables configured  
✅ Basic framework modules created  
✅ Database connection tested  


### Time Investment
- Setup and Poetry: ~20 minutes
- Framework creation: ~15 minutes  
- Debugging and testing: ~15 minutes
- **Total Day 1: ~50 minutes**


### Issues Encountered & Solutions
1. **Poetry 2.0+ shell command removed**
   - Solution: Use `poetry run` instead of `poetry shell`
   - Impact: Changed workflow but no blocking issue

2. **Pydantic BaseSettings import error**
   - Solution: Added `pydantic-settings` dependency and updated imports
   - Learning: Pydantic v2 moved BaseSettings to separate package

3. **Pydantic extra fields validation**
   - Solution: Added `"extra": "allow"` to model_config
   - Learning: Pydantic v2 stricter by default

4. **SQLAlchemy raw SQL execution**
   - Solution: Use `text("SELECT 1")` instead of raw string
   - Learning: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ requires explicit text() wrapper


### Technical Achievements
- ✅ NeonDB connection working with 200ms response time
- ✅ Configuration system loading all environment variables
- ✅ Logging system operational with debug level
- ✅ All core dependencies installed and working

### Next Steps for Day 2
- Create base collector framework
- Implement CoinGecko price data collection
- Create database schema for price data
- Test data collection and storage workflow

---

# Day 2: Database Schema & Price Collection  ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created database models in correct project structure location
- ✅ Implemented base collector framework with error handling
- ✅ Created CoinGecko price data collector
- ✅ Set up database schema with proper indexes
- ✅ Tested complete data collection workflow
- ✅ Verified data storage and retrieval

### Time Investment
- Database model design: ~20 minutes
- Base collector framework: ~15 minutes
- CoinGecko integration: ~15 minutes
- Testing and debugging: ~10 minutes
- **Total Day 2: ~60 minutes**

### Issues Encountered & Solutions
1. **Directory structure deviation**
   - Problem: Initial suggestion deviated from documented project structure
   - Solution: Moved database models to `src/shared/models.py` as documented
   - Learning: Stick to documented structure during implementation

2. **SQLAlchemy text() wrapper needed**
   - Problem: Raw SQL queries needed explicit text() wrapper
   - Solution: Added `text()` import and wrapped SQL strings
   - Learning: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ requires explicit text wrapper

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ Database schema operational with 2 tables and proper indexes
- ✅ CoinGecko API integration collecting 5 cryptocurrencies
- ✅ Complete data collection workflow: API → Processing → Database
- ✅ Error handling and metadata tracking system working
- ✅ Base collector framework ready for news and social data

### Data Collection Results
- Successfully collected: Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Cardano, Solana prices
- Data includes: Price, market cap, volume, 1h/24h/7d changes
- Metadata tracking: Collection status, timing, record counts
- Database indexes: Optimized for symbol and timestamp queries

### Next Steps for Day 3
- Implement CoinDesk news scraping collector
- Create database schema for news articles
- Add text processing and cleaning functionality
- Test news collection and storage workflow

### Major Milestone Achieved

Successfully built:
- Complete database foundation
- Functional data collection framework
- Real-time price data integration
- Error handling and monitoring
- Scalable collector architecture
