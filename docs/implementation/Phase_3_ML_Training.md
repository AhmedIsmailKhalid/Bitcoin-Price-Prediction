- **Class imbalance handling**: Intelligent stratification with fallback for extreme imbalance
- **Feature scaling**: StandardScaler normalization for consistent model input
- **Data validation**: Comprehensive checks before model training

#### **Model Training Results**
- **Dataset**: 8 samples with 20 features (after feature selection)
- **Class distribution**: 7 samples (class 0), 1 sample (class 1) - severe imbalance
- **Logistic Regression**: 100% training accuracy (expected overfitting with limited data)
- **Random Forest**: 87.5% training accuracy (more robust to overfitting)
- **Training strategy**: No test split due to insufficient data and class imbalance

#### **Pipeline Robustness**
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of data quality issues
- **Scalability**: Architecture ready for additional models and larger datasets
- **Automation**: End-to-end training without manual intervention
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seeds and deterministic preprocessing

### Issues Resolved

#### **1. Class Imbalance in Training Data**
- **Problem**: Severe class imbalance (7:1 ratio) prevented stratified train/test splitting
- **Root cause**: Bitcoin price data collected during declining market conditions
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent data splitting with imbalance detection
- **Implementation**: Fallback to full dataset training when splitting not viable
- **Learning**: Real-world financial data often has temporal class imbalances

#### **2. NaN Values in Feature Engineering**
- **Problem**: 9 features contained NaN values causing Logistic Regression to fail
- **Features affected**: volatility_3, volatility_5, volatility_7, volume_change, roc_3, rsi_like, trend_3, trend_5, market_cap_change
- **Root cause**: Technical indicators require multiple price points for calculation
- **Solution**: Median imputation for missing values with logging for transparency
- **Prevention**: Added comprehensive data quality checks before model training

#### **3. Limited Dataset Size**
- **Challenge**: Only 8 temporally aligned samples for training
- **Impact**: Perfect training accuracy indicates overfitting rather than model performance
- **Approach**: Architecture built to scale with additional data collection
- **Validation**: Pipeline proven functional with minimal data requirements

#### **4. Model Overfitting with Limited Data**
- **Observation**: Logistic Regression achieved 100% accuracy on 8 samples
- **Analysis**: Expected behavior with 20 features and minimal training data
- **Random Forest**: Lower accuracy (87.5%) shows better regularization
- **Interpretation**: Results validate pipeline functionality, not predictive performance

### Machine Learning Infrastructure Design

#### **Modular Architecture Benefits**
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new model types (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- **Consistency**: Standardized interface across all model implementations
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities

- **Cross-validation**: Time-series aware validation with proper temporal splits
- **Model comparison**: Systematic comparison across multiple algorithms

### Data Quality Insights

#### **Feature Engineering Validation**

- **Feature categories**: Price (technical indicators), temporal (cyclical), sentiment (aggregated)
- **Missing data patterns**: Technical indicators missing for first price records (expected)
- **Data alignment**: Successful temporal alignment between price and sentiment data

#### **Real-World Data Challenges**
- **Market conditions**: Data collected during predominantly declining Bitcoin prices
