### Technical Architecture

#### **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**
```python
# Core preprocessing workflow
TextPreprocessor
├── clean_text() - URL removal, whitespace normalization
├── remove_punctuation() - Configurable sentiment preservation
├── tokenize() - NLTK-based word tokenization with fallbacks
├── remove_stopwords() - Standard + crypto-specific stopwords
├── lemmatize() - WordNet lemmatization to base forms
└── filter_tokens() - Length and content validation
```

#### **Sentiment Analysis Architecture**
```python
# Multi-method sentiment analysis
SentimentAnalyzer
├── analyze_vader() - VADER compound, positive, neutral, negative scores
├── analyze_textblob() - Polarity (-1 to 1) and subjectivity (0 to 1)
├── analyze_comprehensive() - Combined weighted scoring (60% VADER, 40% TextBlob)
└── analyze_title_vs_content() - Headline-content alignment detection
```

### Issues Encountered & Solutions

#### **1. NLTK Data Dependencies**
- **Problem**: NLTK corpora not automatically available in deployment environments
- **Solution**: Implemented automatic NLTK data downloading with error handling
- **Result**: Robust sentiment analysis across different deployment environments

#### **2. Crypto-Specific Stopwords**
- **Problem**: Standard stopwords insufficient for cryptocurrency content analysis
- **Solution**: Extended stopwords with crypto-specific terms
- **Impact**: Improved sentiment signal-to-noise ratio in analysis

#### **3. Sentiment Score Calibration**
- **Problem**: VADER and TextBlob produce different scale sensitivities
- **Solution**: Weighted combination (60% VADER, 40% TextBlob) based on news text optimization
- **Validation**: Tested on sample articles showing balanced sentiment detection

### Data Processing Results
- **Total articles processed**: 15 articles across 3 news sources
- **Sentiment range**: -0.555 to +0.998 (full spectrum utilization)
- **Processing accuracy**: 100% success rate with no failed articles
- **Database integration**: All sentiment records stored with proper relationships

├── calculate_volatility_indicators() - Rolling volatility and price changes
├── calculate_momentum_indicators() - ROC and RSI-like momentum signals
├── calculate_trend_indicators() - Price position and trend slope analysis
└── calculate_market_cap_features() - Market cap changes and supply indicators
```

├── extract_datetime_features() - Hour, day of week, month, quarter
├── extract_cyclical_features() - Sine/cosine encoding for temporal cycles
├── extract_time_since_features() - Time elapsed since dataset start
└── extract_business_time_features() - Market hours and weekend detection
```

#### **Feature Combination Pipeline**
```python
# Multi-source data integration with temporal alignment
FeatureCombiner
├── get_sentiment_features() - Join sentiment and news data by article
├── aggregate_sentiment_by_time() - Time-window aggregation with resampling
├── create_target_variable() - Price direction and movement classification
├── align_features_by_time() - Temporal alignment with tolerance windows
└── create_complete_feature_set() - End-to-end ML-ready feature generation
```

### Issues Encountered & Solutions

#### **1. Limited Price Data for Technical Indicators**
- **Problem**: Single price record insufficient for moving averages and momentum indicators
- **Solution**: Implemented graceful degradation with available feature calculation
- **Result**: 6 basic features extracted, framework supports 20+ indicators with sufficient data

#### **2. Temporal Alignment Complexity**
- **Problem**: News articles and price data from different time zones and frequencies
- **Solution**: Implemented flexible temporal alignment with configurable tolerance windows
- **Implementation**: UTC normalization with ±2 hour alignment tolerance

#### **3. Pandas Resampling Deprecation Warning**
- **Problem**: Pandas deprecated 'H' frequency string in favor of 'h'

- **Temporal features**: 17 comprehensive time-based indicators
- **Sentiment features**: 11 multi-method sentiment scores and metadata
- **Total capacity**: 35+ features when operating with sufficient price data

### Technical Innovations
